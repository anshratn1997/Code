Erros and Mistake that i did..........
Remember it all the time.
1-Dfs is not recommended to use until  it does not becomes necessary.(cookoffNov17_skiing);
  it may causes StackoverFlowError(NZEC).
2-During modulo operation when subtraction is taken
     then following steps is necessary todo;
     ans=ans%n-p;
     if(ans<0)
      ans+=n;
 3-  If there is error in recursive function print all state variavle at returing point

 4 -
